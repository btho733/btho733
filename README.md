- 👋 Hi, I’m Belvin Thomas
- 👀 As a researcher working with multidimensional datasets, my primary interest has been in converting volumetric data to compelling visuals. I've seen several cases, where such visuals trigger new thought processes. See my recent repositories (Belvin-PhD, Belvin-Personal_projects) for more details.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and developing techniques to improve traditional methods in data (natural images, medical images, text, time series and seq data) processing and analysis.
- 💞️ I’m using the Github platform to share some of my original work and tutorials. I'm looking to collaborate on similar works.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me @btho733@aucklanduni.ac.nz
